craft beer website is a great work that i have made it with bootstrap and it is fully responsive which makes it much perfect, but if you know that how tailwind works, do not use boot until they update it becouse, the corrent version is widly limited and it is not recommended exactly  for nowdays when it compare with tailwind. anyway i put  all the code here, download and enjoy.
